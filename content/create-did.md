Decentralized identity is a trust framework in which identifiers, such as usernames, can be replaced with IDs that are self-owned, independent, and enable data exchange using blockchain technology to protect privacy and secure transactions. As our lives are increasingly linked to apps, devices, and services, weâ€™re often subject to data breaches and privacy loss. A standards-based decentralized identity system can provide greater privacy and control over your data.

Rubix Decentralized IDentity (DID) project is an open standard enabling users to create self-owned identities, and use blockchain networks for getting decentralized tamper proof verifiable claims. The claims are 100% on-chain and publicly verifiable. Every node joining the Rubix platform creates a unique network Decentralized Identity(DID). dID is a 256x256 PNG image that is self-created but verified decentralized by peers in the network. The dID is ubiquity paired with the Peer ID created on the IPFS.

### How many DIDs can I create for one Node?

<div class="note note-helpful">

### DOs

When it comes to creating a DID for your node

- Make sure IPFS setup correctly before creating
- Create only one DID per Rubix Node
- Backup Rubix directory and .ipfs directory in your node often

</div>

### Don'ts

When it comes to creating a DID for your node

- Create multiple DIDs for a same system
- Not backing up or long gap between backups

</div>
