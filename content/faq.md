{{< expand "Are contributions anonymous? Or will my name be attached to my notes?" >}}

We want everyone to feel comfortable contributing to Birdwatch. Because of that, all contributors get a new, auto-generated display name (or alias) when they join Birdwatch. These aliases are not publicly associated with contributorsâ€™ Twitter accounts, so everyone can write and rate notes privately.

You can learn more about aliases [here](../aliases).

{{< expand "Will Birdwatch contributions affect content on Twitter? Will it be used to label or remove Tweets? " >}}

Birdwatch notes that have been rated helpful by enough contributors from [different points of view](../diversity/) will appear directly on Tweets for a small, randomized group of people in the US. They will also be able to rate notes for helpfulness. Beyond that, Birdwatch notes do not affect display of Tweets or enforcement of Twitter Rules. Our focus during this phase of the pilot is gaining confidence that Birdwatch produces context people from [different points of view](../diversity/) find helpful and informative.
